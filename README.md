Addiction Nexus: A Multidimensional Cartography of Behavioral, Neurophysiological, and Socioeconomic Determinants of Dependency Using OLAP and Knowledge Graphs  

📌 Overview  
Addiction is a multidimensional phenomenon, shaped by a complex interplay of behavioral patterns, neurophysiological markers, and socioeconomic factors. To enable scalable, data-driven insights, this dataset has been meticulously designed using a snowflake schema, facilitating hierarchical OLAP analysis and semantic enrichment via RDF knowledge graphs.  

Built upon the QB4OLAP vocabulary, the dataset represents synthetic records for 3,000 individuals, encompassing demographic profiles, lifestyle indicators, addiction statuses, and temporal-spatial contexts. By integrating semantic technologies, it allows for interoperable, queryable, and reusable insights, making it a valuable resource for public health informatics, behavioral research, and addiction analytics.  

🔍 Key Features  
✔ Multidimensional OLAP Structure: Designed for hierarchical and roll-up analyses.  
✔ Semantic Interoperability: RDF representation ensures compatibility with linked data frameworks.  
✔ FAIR Compliance: Ensures optimal Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability.  
✔ Knowledge Graph Integration: Enables advanced SPARQL queries for relational discovery.
